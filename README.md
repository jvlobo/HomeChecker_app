# React Native app to control who is inside or outside the house

Basic app made with React Native which makes request to a NodeJS API to get updated status of who is inside or outside the house.

For POST requests to the API to update the user status I took advantage of IFTT and the Wifi/GPS functionality to know if I'm on the house or not.
